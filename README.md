### Chapter 6

Setting Up Your Database (Depends on your backend choice; code to connect and fetch data will reside in API routes or helper functions)

### Chapter 7

Fetching Data (Handled within API routes or data fetching components, depending on the data source)

### Chapter 8

Static and Dynamic Rendering (Demonstrated through Next.js's automatic rendering and data fetching capabilities)

- Static rendering: data fetching and rendering happens on the server at build time (when you deploy) or when revalidating data.
- Ddynamic rendering: content is rendered on the server for each user at request time (when the user visits the page).

### Chapter 9

Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.
